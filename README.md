Weather Analysis in Hawaii using Sqlite and Jupyter Python.

## Overview
For this analysis we used Sqlite in Jupyter to analyze a table of weather data for Hawii.  We analyzed weather data for the months of June and December to determine temperature patterns during different times of the year.  This data will be used to predict likely ice cream sales in the area.

## Analysis
From our queries of the temperature data, we determined the following:

*  Average temperature was 6 degrees higher in June than in December.
*  Max temperature for June was 83 degrees, while in December it was 78 degrees.
*  Min temperature in June was 71 degrees in June, vs. 60 degrees in December.
*  Overall, the temperatures were in a comfortable range for customers to patronize the shop.


## Summary
The table below shows the results of our queries.  For further analysis we suggest to query both temperature and precipitation for other months during the year.
